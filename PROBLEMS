TABLE_LEN defined in mutliple places
trying to allocate hash_table in main and in encode
changed hash_table to include the next_code variable
last_char in the hash_element must be an int!


decode wasnt implemented correctly:
       //This was missing:
       push finalK on kstack
       c = old

stack code was broken. Comparing size of stack with initial size instead of current
size when deciding if i want to realloc

redefining NOT_FOUND and EMPTY in encode.c

int the table_find I was casting k to a char, but I should have used int values

Didn't propertly initialize mark_prefix_bit in insert_pair

moved the pruning logic to the top of the get_code loop and the get_char loops

created a codec structure to handle writing and reading compressed data
